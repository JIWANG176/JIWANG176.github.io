<p>
        Ensemble methods are considered the state-of-the art solution
        for many machine learning challenges. Such methods improve the 
        predictive performance of a single model by training multiple models 
        and combining their predictions. This paper introduce the concept of 
        ensemble learning, reviews traditional, novel and state-ofthe-art 
        ensemble methods and discusses current challenges and trends in the field.
